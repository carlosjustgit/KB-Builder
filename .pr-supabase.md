## Phase 2: Supabase Audit Complete

This PR adds complete Supabase database schema, RLS policies, and storage configuration.

## What's Included

### 1. Database Migrations

- **001_create_kb_tables.sql** - Creates all 6 core tables
  - kb_sessions (wizard progress tracking)
  - kb_documents (content storage)
  - kb_sources (research citations)
  - kb_images (image registry)
  - kb_visual_guides (visual brand guidelines)
  - kb_exports (export history)

- **002_enable_rls.sql** - Row Level Security policies
  - Owner-only access on all tables
  - Cascading ownership through sessions
  - Tested security policies

### 2. Storage Configuration

- **setup-storage.sql** - Storage bucket and policies
  - Creates kb-builder bucket
  - Configures folder structure
  - Owner-only storage access

### 3. Development Tools

- **seed-local.mjs** - Sample data for local testing
- **SUPABASE_README.md** - Complete setup guide

## Database Schema

All tables use UUID primary keys and include created_at timestamps.
Foreign keys cascade deletes from sessions to all related data.

## Security

- RLS enabled on all tables
- All policies use auth.uid() for owner verification
- Storage files require signed URLs
- Service role key bypasses RLS (server-side only)

## Next Steps

1. Run migrations in Supabase dashboard
2. Create storage bucket
3. Test with seed data (optional)
4. Proceed to Phase 3 (Project Scaffold)
