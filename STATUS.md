## 📋 Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### 1. Push Branches to GitHub

You need to push both branches because I don't have SSH access:

```bash
# Push bootstrap branch
git push -u origin chore/bootstrap

# Push planning branch
git push -u origin docs/plan
```

### 2. Create Pull Requests on GitHub

#### PR-000: Bootstrap
- **Branch:** `chore/bootstrap` → `main`
- **Title:** `chore: initial project bootstrap with dependencies and configuration`
- **Description:**
  ```
  ## Phase 0: Bootstrap Complete
  
  This PR initializes the KB Builder project with:
  
  - Project structure (client, server, supabase directories)
  - All dependencies installed (React, Express, Supabase, AI SDKs, etc.)
  - Configuration files (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier)
  - Basic client and server entry points
  - Environment variable templates
  - README with setup instructions
  
  ### Verification Steps
  1. Clone and `cd` into the repo
  2. Run `pnpm install`
  3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
  4. Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in API keys
  5. Run `pnpm dev` - should start client (port 5173) and server (port 3001)
  6. Visit http://localhost:5173 - should see "KB Builder" heading
  7. Visit http://localhost:3001/api/health - should return `{"status":"ok"}`
  
  ### Files Changed
  - 23 files created
  - 7,286 lines added
  
  **DO NOT MERGE YET** - awaiting review before proceeding to Phase 2
  ```

#### PR-001: Planning Documents
- **Branch:** `docs/plan` → `main`
- **Title:** `docs: add comprehensive planning documents`
- **Description:**
  ```

     - Clear dependencies and ordering
  
  3. **RISKS.md** - Risk register
     - 19 identified risks with severity ratings
     - Mitigation strategies
     - Rollback procedures
     - Monitoring recommendations

  **Approval Required Before Phase 2** (Supabase Audit)
  ```

### 3. Environment Setup (Before Development)

Before proceeding with Phase 2, you need to:

1. **Get Supabase Credentials:**
   - Create or access Supabase project
   - Copy Project URL, Anon Key, Service Role Key
   - Add to `.env` and `.env.local`

2. **Get API Keys:**
   - OpenAI API key
   - Perplexity API key
   - Add to `.env.local`

3. **Verify Local Setup:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # Client: http://localhost:5173
   # Server: http://localhost:3001
   ```
