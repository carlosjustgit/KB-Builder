      "All images must be strictly photorealistic. Never generate illustrations, paintings, renders, cartoons, or abstract designs.",
      "Style must look exactly like a real-life mobile photo, as if captured with a Samsung Galaxy S25.",
      "Images should feel authentic, human, and relatable, avoiding staged or stock-photo looks.",
      "Subtle touches of brand colour (purple #8943FE) may appear in clothing or small details, but never dominate the image.",
      "Every image must look natural and trigger curiosity or emotion, encouraging the viewer to read the caption."

    "style_direction": {
      "lighting": "Natural daylight or realistic indoor lighting. No neon, artificial glow, or over-saturated HDR.",
      "colour": "Natural tones with slight enhancement. Real-world colours with one subtle vivid element.",
      "composition": "Clean focus on the subject, natural background blur when needed.",
      "format": "Square or portrait, optimised for Instagram and social feeds."
    },
    "people_and_emotions": [
      "Real human-like faces, diverse in age, gender, and ethnicity.",
      "Authentic expressions: curiosity, excitement, focus, joy, collaboration.",

      "minimalist_lifestyle": [
        "Single everyday object in focus (coffee mug, phone, desk item) with a vivid accent.",

      "Curiosity: visual hints that encourage the viewer to seek context in the caption.",
      "Belonging: small groups or shared everyday experiences.",

    "prompting_guidance": [
      "Always include: 'strictly photorealistic, captured with Samsung Galaxy S25, natural light, real people, authentic everyday moment'.",
      "Add one contextual keyword: curiosity, joy, collaboration, focus, discovery.",
      "Add one stylistic element: subtle purple accent, minimal background, lifestyle realism.",
      "Strictly avoid: painting, drawing, illustration, abstract, 3D render, cartoon, surreal, glowing futuristic effects."
